                <p>This was our second negotiated project for the year and I chose to do 3D modelling using blender.  </p>
            
            <p style="font-size: 17px; background-color: orange; display: inline-block; padding: 5px; margin-bottom: 0px;"> Objectives </p>
            
                <p>My first objective was to make a 3D gun with materials. The handle and body of the gun would be a lightish brown and the trigger and loading thing would be a slivery metallic material. I also wanted to make a dice, something that I thought would be pretty hard but was kind of easy.</p>
            
            <p style="font-size: 17px; background-color: orange; display: inline-block; padding: 5px; margin-bottom: 0px;"> Method - Gun </p>
            
                <p>I started out by finding an image of the gun I would model, moved it in to blender then started modelling using e to make new segments of the model and g to move selected parts of the model. After I had the basic shape of the gun I made the trigger and the loading thing with a small barrel on the end. I then smoothed off some parts and shaped the handle a bit more. Then I started to make materials I would assign to parts of the model, the body of the gun was light brown and the trigger and loading part were grey and metallic..</p>
            
            <p style="font-size: 17px; background-color: orange; display: inline-block; padding: 5px; margin-bottom: 0px;"> Method - Dice </p>
            
                <p>I followed some tutorials made by youtubers and made some modifications to it. I changed the shape of the dice to make it more round and made the divots a bit deeper. I started with a cube and in edit mode I subdivided it and changed the amount of cuts to 4. This gave me a 5x5 area to work with on each side. I selected the faces where the dots would be, opposite sides adding up to seven. After that I pressed e and then s to make the divots a bit smaller and so they wouldn’t be combined. Then I made the divots in the dice and assigned textures to the dots and the shell of the dice. Then I duplicated it made a basic ceiling lamp and added a ball with physics to make the dice fly everywhere.</p>
            
            <p style="font-size: 17px; background-color: orange; display: inline-block; padding: 5px; margin-bottom: 0px;"> Results/Problems and Solutions </p>
            
                <p>The first problem I had was trying to make the gun look smoother and better looking, but it didn’t end up working. <br>
                The second problem I encountered was the surface the dice were on, I wanted it to look like a cloth material but I couldn’t end up doing it.<br>
                I think that the dice ended up looking pretty good but the gun wasn’t that great.</p>
