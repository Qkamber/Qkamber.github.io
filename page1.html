                <p>In the first part of Term 1 we worked on making websites that would be used to show our parents what we have been doing during the year, and so we can put our project reports online. </p>

                <p>We made an Educational VR World that primary school kids would be able learn from and navigate. The theme for all the VR worlds to be based around was World War II, and our world was about Bunkers. Some people would pair up with someone else. I was in a group with Khye.</p>
            
            <p style="font-size: 17px; background-color: orange; display: inline-block; padding: 5px; margin-bottom: 0px;"> Objectives </p>
            
                <p>We wanted to make a VR World that people in primary school could understand and learn from, in this case Bunkers. This world had to have some basic models about our topic, so we included a small bunker, some soldiers and some vehicles such as motorcycles and a car. We also had to include some images and some text about what the topic is and an example of what they were used for in wars.</p>
            
            <p style="font-size: 17px; background-color: orange; display: inline-block; padding: 5px; margin-bottom: 0px;"> Method </p>
            
                <p>Firstly, we would find some models which don’t have more than 200 000 polys and are downloadable. We would next download them in the .glTF format. We then would put the models, text and images, then give the USB to Doug, who would help us put the models, text and images where we wanted. We would then look at the world using some VR Headsets so we can see how it will look when others view it.</p>
            
            <p style="font-size: 17px; background-color: orange; display: inline-block; padding: 5px; margin-bottom: 0px;"> Results/Problems and Solutions </p>
            
                <p>We had a couple of problems when making the VR World. One was that we had trouble finding models that would look good, such as a decent looking bunker. To solve this, we would just change the filters a bit so we could get models with more polys and better textures. <br> <br>
                
                We also had the problem of finding accurate information and images. The information we looked at changed from page to page making it hard to tell what was real and what wasn’t. We ended up just combining some of the information just so we would have some text on it.</p>
